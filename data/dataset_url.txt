The dataset used in this project is too large to be uploaded to GitHub

Therefore, I have attached the link to the dataset below:

    https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data

The dataset upon downloading will not be encoded therefore, run 'data_engineering.py' to encode the dataset

## Jack Greenaway MSc Financial Technology Final Project

### An Application of Artificial Intelligence for Credit Risk Management with Comparisons to Traditional Methods

This is the repository for my final project during my MSc

The project focuses on using TensorFlow to create a neural network capable of classifying credit applications on their credit worthiness
(will they default or not...)

It draws comparisons to traditional methods like logistic regressions

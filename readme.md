## Jack Greenaway MSc Financial Technology Final Project

### An Application of Artificial Intelligence for Credit Risk Management with Comparisons to Traditional Methods

This is the repository for my final project during my MSc Financial Technology

The goal of this project is to compare traditional methods of credit applicants by whether they'll default or not

In this project, I have created a neural network using TensorFlow. It leverages hyperparameter tuning to optimise the generalisation. 

The traditional methods I will be a logistic regression, (plus more as I continue my literature review)

The dataset utilised in the model isn't paramount to the project (the creation and application of the models are) therefore, it is trained and tested on a dataset from Kaggle.com

Jobs todo:
- Perfect the current models
    - Find model parameters (logistic regression/linear discriminant analysis) used in previous research
    - Maybe try different optimisation techniques?
